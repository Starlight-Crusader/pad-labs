## Microservice-based Chess Website

### Application Suitability Assessment
1. Chess websites may experience different levels of traffic in different parts of the system, for example during tournaments, live broadcasts, or when new features are released. Microservices allow **to independently scale** high-load services without affecting other parts of the system.*
2. Microservices enable working on independent features or services without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes. It becomes possible **to update or deploy individual services** without redeploying the entire application.
* e.g., *Chess.com* separates its puzzle generator, allowing a dedicated team to work on improving it, deploy new algorithms, or fix bugs without disrupting other critical services like matchmaking or game analysis.

### Service Boundaries (architecture.png)
* Service A handles everything regarding the **user data**: authentication, friend system, rating
* Service B handles everything related to the **games played** on the website: lobbies (including spectators), moves recording

### Technology Stack and Communication Patterns
* Service A: **Express** + **MongoDB**
* Service B: **Django** + **Dj Channels** (WS) + **Redis** (Channels storage)
* API Gateway: Express
* Inter-service communication: RESTful APIs

### Data Management Design
* Service A endpoints
